A Sentiment Analysis of Uberâ€™s Customer Reviews: A deep dive analysis
Sentiment analysis of social media reviews are mostly done at the basic level using machine learning and algorithms which only scratches the surface.  However, this report is based on a thorough analysis of Twitter reviews on Uber.  
Excel Power Query has been used for text analysis. The text mining part included random sampling to mitigate bias, cleaning and extracting comments with text length of equal or less than 400 letters.  A dataset with 250 comments was then prepared for sentiment analysis.    Power Query was also used to conduct a word count to find the most mentioned words and related key words.  The top 5 most mentioned words are: Service, Customer, Driver, Price, Safety.  As such, the dataset has been categorized into five categories:
Service, Customer Experience, Driver Performance, Price, Safety
Sentiment Analysis:
For the sake of thorough analysis, each phrase (comment) was reviewed and scored.  The scoring criteria used is:
Excellent/professional/love it/super = 3, Very good/comfortable/convenient = 2, Okay/good/nice = 1, Bad/inconvenient/uncomfortable = -1, Dirty/rude/unprofessional/very bad/unacceptable = -2, Crime/harassment/very rude/worst = -3
Buzz:
The word count from Power Query was also used to find out how many times each category or related keywords have been mentioned or spoken about or buzzed.
This graph explains it all:
 
Customer experience and driver performance have a positive average sentiment; but incredibly low.  There is 22.44% buzz about drivers, a higher percentage than other categories, which shows that drivers seem to be the driving force of Uber.
Price, Service and Safety have negative sentiment scores which means that customers are not happy, prices are high or fluctuates and service is not up to standard.  Safety with a sentiment score of -1.35 and price with a sentiment score of -1.43 are of great concern to customers. 
Recommendations:
Uber should focus on standardizing and improving all five categories.  Based on reviews, customers have several complaints on price fluctuations and high price quotes and charges.  A standard base fare, uniform price/mile/time during normal hours and a % increase during surge hours or a uniform surge price need to be set, so customers know what to expect.
A key connected word to Service is the Uber App.  Service is also an umbrella category, by improving the App and other four categories, Service can be improved.
In addition, improved safety measures need to be taken by conducting thorough background checks on drivers and periodic physical inspection on cars to ensure customers feel secure while using Uber.  Customers have also mentioned fraudulent use of their bank accounts used in Uber App or fraudulent charges on their accounts by Uber.  Uber needs to ensure the App is secured and the software is improved to detect hackers and fraudulent activities through advertisements or other users.
Although, Driver Performance has a positive sentiment score, it is relatively low.  Uber needs to work on improving driver service, by providing trainings to drivers. Also, a proven strategy to improve personnel performance is by providing monetary incentives, like bonuses or rewards.  
By standardizing price, improving Service and Safety, customers will have better experience riding with Uber and will increase the average positive sentiment.
